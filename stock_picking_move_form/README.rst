=======================
stock_picking_move_form
=======================

Adds an "info" button to the stock.picking form view, allowing you to easily
open the stock.move form view.

This is a UX improvement to more easily allow the stock.move form view to be
opened, which was easily do-able under 12.0 by simply clicking on the line.
Under 14.0+ this makes the line editable in certain circumstances.
